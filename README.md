# Mustang

Mustang is an generative adversarial networks (GANs) training framework that combines E-GANs [1], which apply the principles of evolutionary computation to train GANs by generating diversity in terms of (gradient-based) mutationts applied to the generator, and Lipizzaner [2], which uses a spatially distributed coevolutioary algorithms to optimize two populations of networks (generators and discriminators). Mustan mitigates problems such as instability and mode collapse during the training process.
